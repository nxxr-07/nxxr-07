## 🚀 About Me

I’m a passionate software engineer who loves building real-world solutions across platforms. While I started with Android development, I’ve expanded into full-stack web development and backend engineering using technologies like **Python Flask**, **Java Spring Boot**, and **MySQL**.

I enjoy working on apps and APIs that solve practical problems — from home service platforms to quiz-based learning apps. My focus is on writing clean, maintainable code, learning new frameworks, and delivering functional projects end to end.

Currently exploring **Java Spring Boot** and sharpening my backend engineering skills.
