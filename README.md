## 🚀 About Me

I’m a passionate Android developer who loves building real-world solutions using **Java**, **Kotlin**, and **Jetpack Compose**. I specialize in building apps that solve everyday problems — from study room booking systems to digital libraries. I’m also skilled in working with **Firebase**, **REST APIs**, and database systems like **MySQL** and **SQLite3**.

Currently, I’m sharpening my core development skills through internships and collaborative projects while maintaining a top GPA across both my university and IIT Madras courses.
